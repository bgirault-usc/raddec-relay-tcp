raddec-relay-tcp
================

Based on [raddec-relay-udp](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec-relay-udp), and adapted to setup a TCP connection instead of sending UDP packets.

Relay raddecs to and from remote servers over TCP
-------------------------------------------------

Relay raddecs to and from remote servers over TCP.  Can be used standalone, as described below, or behind a [raddec-relay](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec-relay) interface to abstract away the details of the transport protocol.


Installation
------------

    git clone https://github.com/bgirault-usc/raddec-relay-tcp
    npm install raddec-relay-tcp


Hello raddec-relay-tcp!
-----------------------

The following code will configure the relaying of raddecs to localhost (127.0.0.1) and will create and send a single test raddec.

```javascript
const RaddecRelayTcp = require('raddec-relay-tcp');
const Raddec = require('raddec');

const targets = [ { address: "127.0.0.1" } ];

let relay = new RaddecRelayTcp({ targets: targets });

let raddec = new Raddec({
    transmitterId: "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff",
    transmitterIdType: Raddec.identifiers.TYPE_EUI48
});

relay.relayRaddec(raddec);  // Relay the raddec as configured
```


Configuration Examples
----------------------

__raddec-relay-tcp__ supports a variety of configurations for receiving and/or relaying raddecs over TCP, as described in the following examples.

### Example: relay raddecs to remote server(s)

```javascript
const RaddecRelayTcp = require('raddec-relay-tcp');

const targets = [
    { address: "12.34.56.78", port: 50001 },
    { address: "98.76.54.32", port: 50001 }
];

let relay = new RaddecRelayTcp({ targets: targets });

let raddec = ...;  // Typically locally decoded radio packets in this case

relay.relayRaddec(raddec);  // Relay the raddec to the remote servers
```

### Example: listen for and handle inbound raddecs

```javascript
const RaddecRelayTcp = require('raddec-relay-tcp');

const sources = [ { address: "0.0.0.0", port: 50001 } ];

let relay = new RaddecRelayTcp({ sources: sources,
                                 raddecHandler: handleRaddec });

function handleRaddec(raddec) {
  // Do something with the received raddec
}
```

### Example: relay raddecs from source(s) to target(s)

```javascript
const RaddecRelayTcp = require('raddec-relay-tcp');

const sources = [ { address: "0.0.0.0", port: 50001 } ];
const targets = [ { address: "12.34.56.78", port: 50001 } ];

let relay = new RaddecRelayTcp({ sources: sources,
                                 targets: targets });
```


Options
-------

__raddec-relay-tcp__ supports the following options:

| Property               | Default | Description                            | 
|:-----------------------|:--------|:---------------------------------------|
| sources                | []      | Array of sources, each an object with address and port properties (default port is 50001) |
| targets                | []      | Array of targets, each an object with address and port properties (default port is 50001) |
| raddecEncodingOptions  | { includeTimestamp: true, includePackets: true } | Options for encoding raddecs sent to targets |
| enableForwarding       | true    | Forward raddecs from sources to targets (if both are present) |
| raddecHandler          | null    | Function to call when source raddec received |
| tcpServerListeningCallback |     | Function to call when the server (source) TCP port is opened |
| tcpServerRaddecErrorCallback | () => {} | Function to call when an invalid raddec is received |
| tcpClientReadyCallback |         | Function to when the TCP socket to the server (target) to forward raddec to is opened |
| tcpForwardErrorCallback | () => {} | Function to call when the TCP layer returns an error after sending a raddec |
